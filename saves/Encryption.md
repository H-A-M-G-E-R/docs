# Save File Encyption

Progression (save) files in Smash Hit (and other Mediocre games) are encrypted, though it is usually weak.

## Background

In the user data folder for Smash Hit, there are a few different files: one for achivements, one for the configuration, quicksave info, `key.dat` and the save progression file.

The save progression file is `progression.xml` and is the only encrypted file.

## Encryption

> TODO Actually explain the encryption

The encryption is essentially just a Vigen√®re cipher with an added constant to make the keystream less obvious.

For the byte at index `n`, the chipertext is `Key[n % KeyLength] + (PlaintextLength % 256)` added to the original byte. (Or to say it differently: that is the keystream at each byte.)

## Keys

For quick reference, here are the keys for some of the games:

| Game | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Sprinkle Islands | `0u1er0ck5` |
| Granny Smith | `gr4nny0n5k47es` |
| Smash Hit | `5m45hh1t41ght` |
| Beyondium | `d1r4c15Da5h1T` |
| Does not Commute | `d035n0tc0mmut3inl33t` |
| PinOut | `n01t15ntp1n0ut1s` |
